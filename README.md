# Svelteboard

An imageboard created with Svelte. No client-side Javascript so is safe for TOR and other applications.

## Deployment

Deploying other people's software, especially the ones you find in their GitHub repos, is a huge pain in the ass. If something in here confuses you, please open an issue or DM me!

I also recommend you deploy this on a Linux machine. Windows is truly only good for gaming and other niche applications. Ubuntu works best.
### Priors (you'll need):
- A Supabase instance, cloud is fine. If you want maximum control over your data, though, i.e., you live under an oppressive government, look into performing a local deployment of Supabase.
- NodeJS and NPM.

### Installation & Setup
First, clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imake-ds-team/svelteboard.git
```

Then, install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Then, populate your dotenv file:

```bash
cd svelteboard
touch .env
echo IMAGEBOARD_NAME="'insert_name_here'" >> .env
echo IMAGEBOARD_DESCRIPTION="'insert description here'" >> .env
echo IMAGEBOARD_WELCOME_MESSAGE="'insert welcome message here'" >> .env
echo SUPABASE_KEY="'insert supabase anon key here'" >> .env
echo PROJECT_URL="'insert supabase project url here'" >> .env
```

#### Customization
You can go to `style.css` and alter the variables there. You can also install custom fonts with a [webfont generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). I like to get my fonts for free from [Dafont](https://www.dafont.com/).

### Supabase Project Setup
After you intialize your project, go to your SQL editor and run:

```sql
create table boards (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone ('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  name text not null,
  abbreviation text not null,
  description text not null,
  threads jsonb not null
);

alter table boards enable row level security;

create policy "Enable read access for all users" on "public"."boards" to public using (true);
```
