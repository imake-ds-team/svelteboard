# Svelteboard

An imageboard created with Svelte. No client-side Javascript so is safe for TOR and other applications.

## Deployment

Deploying other people's software, especially the ones you find in their GitHub repos, is a huge pain in the ass. If something in here confuses you, please open an issue or DM me!

I also recommend you deploy this on a Linux machine. Windows is truly only good for gaming and other niche applications. Ubuntu works best.
### Priors (you'll need):
- A Supabase instance, cloud is fine. If you want maximum control over your data, though, i.e., you live under an oppressive government, look into performing a local deployment of Supabase.
- NodeJS and NPM.

### Installation & Setup
First, clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imake-ds-team/svelteboard.git
```

Then, install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Then, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and thats where all of your configurations can be found.

#### Customization
You can go to `app.css` and alter the variables there. You can also install custom fonts with a [webfont generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). I like to get my fonts for free from [Dafont](https://www.dafont.com/).

### Supabase Project Setup
After you intialize your project, go to your SQL editor and create your table for boards:

```sql
create table boards (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone ('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  name text not null,
  abbreviation text not null,
  description text not null,
);

alter table boards enable row level security;

create policy "Enable read access for all users" on "public"."boards" to public using (true);
```

now create your table for threads:

```sql
create table threads (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone ('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  title text not null,
  content text not null,
  replies jsonb null,
  gtripcode text null,
  board not null
);

alter table threads enable row level security;

create policy "Enable read access for all users" on "public"."threads" to public using (true);
create policy "Allow anyone to insert" on "public"."threads" to public with check (true);
```
